Plan: have a server and a client object, client can fill in different bit rate adaptation algorithms.

What are we measuring? Throughput (packets/second?) 
"For all the measurements, the throughput for each algorithm or bit-rate was measured by counting the number of packets that the sender received an acknowledgment for from the receiver."

"SampleRate calculates the transmission time for each packet using the packet length, bit-rate, and the number of re-tries (including 802.11 back-off)."

--if the send fails, what should we add to the record table as the TX time? Timeout time?

samplerate returns a rate, and is passed (bitrate, ack_rcvd, TX_time)
--is TX time RTT?
