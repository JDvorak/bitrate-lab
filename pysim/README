Plan: have a server and a client object, client can fill in different bit rate adaptation algorithms.

What are we measuring? Throughput (packets/second?) 
"For all the measurements, the throughput for each algorithm or bit-rate was measured by counting the number of packets that the sender received an acknowledgment for from the receiver."

"SampleRate calculates the transmission time for each packet using the packet length, bit-rate, and the number of re-tries (including 802.11 back-off)."

--if the send fails, what should we add to the record table as the TX time? Timeout time?

samplerate returns a rate, and is passed (bitrate, ack_rcvd, TX_time)
--is TX time RTT?


How to store data?
Dictionary keyed by rate?

-broadcast has no link-layer acks. the broadcasts are use to measure the 'lossless tx rate'
-"a 1500 byte broadcast packet at 11 megabits takes 1873 microseconds", so no ack

-we are using 802.11g
Future work: 802.11n

Retries vs. Failures

If no packets have been successfully acknowledged, return the highest bit-rate that
has not had 4 successive failures.

question: what should approach be if we fail out at a high rate, but the lower rates have not been tried and thus have an infinite average TX?
